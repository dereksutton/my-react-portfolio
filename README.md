# Derek Sutton - Full Stack Developer Portfolio

## Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository of my personal developer portfolio website. As a full-stack web developer with a unique blend of entrepreneurial and IT recruitment experience, I have created this website to showcase my skills, projects, and provide ways to connect with me.

The website is built using React and TailwindCSS for styling, allowing for a responsive and visually pleasing user experience.

## Features
1. **About Me**: This section provides a comprehensive background about my experience, skills, and interests.
2. **Portfolio**: Showcases the projects that I have worked on. Each project card contains a brief description of the project along with relevant technologies used and links to the live site and GitHub repository.
3. **Contact**: A functional contact form for users to reach out to me.
4. **Resume**: Showcases the technologies that I'm proficient with, along with a downloadable updated version of my professional resume.

## Technologies Used
- React
- TailwindCSS
- Node.js
- Express.js

## Deployment
The website is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed at [Portfolio](https://fast-coast-07824-cf09a83cc55c.herokuapp.com/).

## Future Development
Future updates will include more projects as I continue to grow as a developer, as well as any new skills or technologies I learn. I also plan to continue improving upon the UI.
